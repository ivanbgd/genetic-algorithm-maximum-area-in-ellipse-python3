# Genetic_Algorithm_01
Genetic Algorithm in Python for inscribing a triangle of the maximum area in a given ellipse.

Ellipse is defined as: (x/a)^2  + (y/b)^2 = 1

User can change parameters of the GA and ellipse.

There are two versions.

The first one represents chromosomes as strings, the second one as integers.

Nevertheless, they are of the same speed.
